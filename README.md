# TBA

TBA ILLUSTRATES THE ACTIONS OF TWO SIMULAR SYSTEMS COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER ON A FIXED GRIT ON 77 SQUARES. BOTS TRADE BITCOIN AGAINST USDT/BUSD, THE BIGGEST COINS IN THE GAME.VISSUALLY INSPIRED BY GERD RICHTERS(MAYBE ALSO THE BIGGEST PLAYER ALIVE) "FARBEN", A COLORWISE MORE SIMPLE VERSION IS PRODUCED HERE, AS BOT1 IS COLORED BLUE, BOT2 YELLOW, POSITIVE TRADES GREEN AND LOSS RED. 

AT THIS MOMENT THIS VISUALISATION IS NOT MORE THAN A COMPARISON THESE SYSTEMS WITH EACH OTHER.
IN THE NEAR FUTURE XXX WILL DISPLAY A MODERN GAME OF "SURVIAL OF THE FITTEST", WHERE THE USER CAN CHOOSE A SYSTEM AND THESE SYSTMES FIGHT EACH OTHER ON THE GRIT, TAKE OVER ALREADY CONQUERED CELLS BY ACHIVING HIGHER RESULTS 
AND PAINT EVEN MORE COLORFUL PICTURES.

HOW TO REPRODUCE: 

1. CREATE SQL DATABASE: DF_TraidsUSDTBUSD.ipynb / OR USE THE SAMPLE DB "TRAIDS"
2. RUN BOTH BOT SCRIPTS & WAIT UNTIL BOTH BOTS TRADED AT LEAST 50x (OTHERWISE ADJUST THE ARRAY IN THE GRIT FILE)
3. RUN GRIT.ipynb
